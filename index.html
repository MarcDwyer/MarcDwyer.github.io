              <p class="card-text"> Fetcherapp does as the name implies, fetches data from Youtube's API notifying 
                users if a streamers is currently live and updates streamers status in real time. For This
                app, I used NodeJS & Express for the backend. Node controls the requests to Youtube's API
                to ensure control over the amount of requests as well as hiding my own API key. This project was
                incredibly fun and gave me an idea of what my next project would be.

              <p class="card-text">
                  This was my very first serious project. The project was tasked to me when taking Udacity's Front End
                  Web Dev course. It being my first, I ended up using jQuery, even still, the code is unnecessarily convoluted. I like to
                  look back on this project from time to time to see how far I've progressed in the 8 months I've been programming.

                <p class="card-text">
                  I chose to build this project because I really desired to work/learn the backend. Creating an API and using Authentication has always
                  been something that interested since finishing my Youtube project. I really wanted to know how the backend works, and found it fascinating. So thats
                  what I attempted to do with this project. I learned how to use MongoDB for my database as well as Passport.JS to authenticate users with Google+.

                    <p class="card-text">The JavaScript 30 course consists of 30 projects that are meant to be done daily for 30 days.
                      The course covers quite a bit, from creating clocks, sorting arrays, CSS heavy exercises, as well as fundamental
                      tasks a Web Dev should know how to perform with just Javascript. I took this course because I lacked base knowledge of
                      Javascript. Having finished this course, I can say that my Javascript has gotten much stronger.

   <h2>About me</h2>
   <h5>Alow me to introduce myself...</h5>
   <div class="para">
    <p>I am a 'self taught' developer from a small town called Navarre. I've been developing for around a year.
      From taking Udacity's Front End Dev program to making my own projects. My current focus is using React-Redux 
      as I enjoy and find it simple yet powerful. I have used both Windows 10 and MacOS as development machines and have no issues with either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past year my main focus is to 'master' Javascript. Although I still have a long way to go... I have come very far. I frequent codewars as well as make simple tools for myself in JS 
      for myself and for others (you can find some on my github). After feeling comfortable with JS I took Stephen Grider's React-Redux course and was amazed at how much easier it made programming! 
      Although my main focus has been Javascript I also have delved deeply into html5/css3 and learning responsive design (Flexbox & CSS Grid). This can be viewed in my Fetcherapp project. I made the app usuable for all enviroments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have become proficient at React-Redux. I am now meddling with some back-end aspects such as mongoDB as well as some authentication methods. I've currently deployed
      a Forum app that does all these things. But am still hungry to learn more of the back-end.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work as an Independent Web Developer. My software is free and available for use by anybody. I spend anywhere from around 6 to 12 hours a day on Web Development (no im not exaggerating). 
      I really do enjoy Web Development, being constantly challenged every single day is the best part. Getting stuck on a problem for hours and attempting to solve it on your own is frustrating yet 
      gratifying once you've fixed it.
